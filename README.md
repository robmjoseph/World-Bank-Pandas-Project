# World-Bank-Pandas-Project

This is a simple project geared towards using Pandas to practice data wrangling on data stored in the JSON file format. 
A JSON file from the World Bank website was used in the exercise and the data cleaning techniques taught 
in the previous lessons had to be implemented in order to answer 3 questions successfully.
